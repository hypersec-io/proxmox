## [2.1.2] - 2025-10-30

### Added

- Chrony (NTP) time synchronization configuration in proxmox-optimize.sh
- Installation of 99-proxmox-cluster.conf for improved cluster time stability
- Step counter updated from 7 to 8 steps in optimization script

### Changed

- Updated recommended script execution order in README.md
  - New order: repo → optimize → zfs → power (optional) → network (optional)
- Changed installation method to prefer download/unzip over git clone
- Updated all repository references to hypersec-io/proxmox

### Fixed

- README.md now uses main branch zip for "latest" downloads instead of version-specific releases

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- Corrected sysctl.d file load order to ensure network settings (99-proxmox-network.conf) properly override base optimize settings (98-proxmox-optimize.conf)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed version numbers from script headers (managed by semantic-release)
- Thermal management now part of `proxmox-power-management.sh` instead of optimize script

- Updated all script headers with Apache 2.0 license
- Updated `proxmox-repo.sh` header comments for clarity
- Improved logical organization of features
- README now references Apache 2.0 instead of MIT

### Removed
- Non-functional subscription nag removal code

- Outdated references to subscription nag in comments
- Version numbers from code headers (now in package.json only)

### Fixed
- Corrected step numbering throughout optimize script
- Removed ineffective proxmoxlib.js patching code
